# Unexpected Null Return in Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a JavaScript function designed to add two numbers. The function unexpectedly returns `null` if either input is `null`, but it doesn't explicitly handle cases where input values might be `undefined` or `NaN` (Not a Number).  This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors in applications.

## Bug Description
The `foo` function, which is intended to add two numbers, returns `null` if either input `a` or `b` is `null`. However, it doesn't handle other falsy values like `undefined` or `NaN` correctly. This lack of comprehensive handling makes the function less robust and reliable.

## Solution
The improved `foo` function now includes explicit checks for `undefined` and `NaN`, ensuring that the function handles a wider range of potential inputs more gracefully and predictably.
